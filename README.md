# Data-Structures

Implementations of various C++ data structures completed during an Electrical/Computer Engineering Course taught by Professor Douglas Wilhelm Harder: 
1: Double Sentinel Linked List 
2: Resizable Deque
3: AVL Search Tree
4: Quadratic Hash Table 
5: Weighted Graph (Dijkstra algorithm) 
*Note: I do not allow anyone to use these implementations as their own

# Data-Structures

Implementations of various C++ data structures used to develop further understanding of base programming algorithm and data structures knowledge. The repository features implementations for:

1: Double Sentinel Linked List 

2: Resizable Deque

3: AVL Search Tree

4: Quadratic Hash Table 

5: Weighted Graph (Dijkstra algorithm) 

*Note: I do not allow anyone to use these implementations as their own

## Getting Started

These C++ classes could be compiled using a C++ compiler and the provided methods can be called and executed via user inputs. 

### Prerequisites

Ideally the most recent C++ compiler versions, I used the following when building and testing the application.

```
MinGW gcc v6.0.0
```

## Built With
